# Anonymized Python Pipeline for Early Fault Detection in High-Speed Nonwoven Fabric Processes

This repository contains the complete data architecture and Python-based analysis pipeline developed for early fault detection in high-speed industrial nonwoven fabric processes.

The work was carried out as part of a Master’s thesis in **Computational Mechanics** at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, in collaboration with **Procter & Gamble, Germany**.

## Overview
The repository documents a structured, end-to-end pipeline including:
- Time-series data ingestion and preprocessing
- Physics-informed and statistical feature construction
- Integration of downtime and event data
- PCA-based monitoring across multiple operating regimes
- Development and validation of an early-alarm detection model

## Execution Environment
The implementation was developed and executed in a Databricks environment using **Python** and **PySpark**.

## Data and Anonymization
Due to industrial confidentiality constraints:
- No raw industrial data is included
- All signal names, controllers, site identifiers, and process-specific details have been anonymized
- Dummy placeholders are used where necessary

The repository preserves methodological structure and computational logic only.

## Intended Use
The purpose of sharing this code is to:
- Demonstrate a reproducible methodological pipeline
- Enable re-application to similar high-speed nonwoven fabric layering processes
- Serve as a reference for comparable continuous manufacturing systems

This repository is **not** intended to replicate or disclose any proprietary industrial system.

## Thesis Context
This repository accompanies the Master’s thesis:

**“Process Analysis and Data-Driven Modeling for Fault Detection in High-Speed Layering of Nonwoven Fabrics”**
